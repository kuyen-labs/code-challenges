# Fuul Backend Code Challenge

Fuul is helping one of their projects that runs an NFT marketplace which sells (only) 3 products:


```
Code         | Name                |  Price
-------------------------------------------------
APE          | Bored Apes          |   75 ETH
PUNK         | Crypto Punks        |   60 ETH
MEEBIT       | Meebits             |    4 ETH
```

They are offering the following discounts:

* The marketing department believes in 2-for-1 promotions (buy two of the same product, get one free), and would like for there to be a 2-for-1 special on APE items.

* The CFO insists that the best way to increase sales is with discounts on bulk purchases (buying x or more of a product, the price of that product is reduced), and demands that if you buy 3 or more PUNK items, the price per unit should be 50 ETH.


The NFT marketplace's checkout process allows for items to be scanned in any order, and should return the total amount to be paid. The interface for the checkout process looks like this (ruby):

```co = Checkout.new(pricing_rules)
co.scan("APE")
co.scan("APE")
co.scan("PUNK")
price = co.total
```

Using ruby, node, go or JAVA, implement a checkout process that fulfills the requirements.

```
Items: APE, PUNK, MEEBIT
Total: 139 ETH

Items: APE, PUNK, APE
Total: 135 ETH

Items: PUNK, PUNK, PUNK, APE, PUNK
Total: 275 ETH

Items: APE, PUNK, APE, APE, MEEBIT, PUNK, PUNK
Total: 304 ETH
```

#### The code should:

* Be written as production-ready code. You will write production code.
* Be easy to grow and easy to add new functionality.
* Have notes attached, explaining the solution and why certain things are included and others are left out.
